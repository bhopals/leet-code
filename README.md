- BINARY SEARCH
  In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search or logarithmic search, is a search algorithm that is commonly used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. However, the binary search algorithm is not limited to arrays. In any scenario where one can determine if the target value is higher or lower than a given value, binary search can be used to repeatedly halve the search space for a target value.
